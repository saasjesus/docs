## Channels

The goal is to use 1 Flow for ALL Channels. Currently Workflows work with:

- **Email**
- **Web Widget**

... next Channels are gradually being rolled out

## How to Trigger?

### With AI

Similar to [Handover Topics](/ai/handover-topics) or [Auto Tagging](/ai/auto-tagging), you can give the AI the capability to **trigger your Workflows** based on your Description. [More here](/ai/using-workflows)

### Manually in Tickets

For triggering Flows in Tickets manually, you will **NEED** to **publish your Flow** to take the latest changes. You can trigger it then here:

![Trigger Flow In Ticket Pn](/images/trigger_flow_in_ticket.png)

## How to Test

You can basically simulate a Ticket Conversation by just clicking "**Test Flow**" in the top right of the Flow-Builder:

![Test Flow Pn](/images/test_flow.png)

This will take your **current Flow Changes**. You do **NOT** have to publish your changes when you **test flows**
