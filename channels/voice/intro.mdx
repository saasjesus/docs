**0:00** Hi, so we just set up a voice assistant. Here you can find all the transcript as well as the quick, uhm, recording. \
**0:09** And the customer summary as well as the customer information including the phone number. And obviously here I do have the filter for channel voice, but that's it. \
**0:19** How can I configure the voice assistant? Uhm, I'm gonna just, ah, put, make it here by putting it prompting the voice, putting the welcome message, actually naming it and choosing a voice. You can test the voices as well. \
**0:30** And setting some settings including the forward number for escalation. Back to the phone agent, how can I add a new one? 0:38 Just enter a display name and choose a phone number. Uhm, for example, for Germany, choose the ones offered here. And then, uhm, go through the configuration that I just introduced. 0:53 Have fun with our phone, uh, voice AI channel in ArminCX.
