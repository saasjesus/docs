# **About Views & Subviews**

The inbox is a frontend-display-feature that enables you to set default views based on your company's needs:

- teams
- brands
- shops
- languages

... on whatever base you want operations to seamlessly oversight what's going on, views lets you

- conglomerate the channels needed, in one "master-inbox-view"
- decentralize ticketing analytics based on segmented views introduced above
- assign admin-rights based on your company's infrastructure

..watch the video above (2min) to understand the inbox and get going\!

## Subviews

You can easily create Subviews, by:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Click on "Add View"'>
    Click on "\+ Add View" in the Inbox\
    ![Add View Pn](/images/add_view.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Subview">
    Next, you type in the **Parent Views' Name** followed by "**::**" and the **Subviews' Name**. Like this:

    ![Create Sub View Pn](/images/create_sub_view.png)

    Here you will see, that it **initially** takes the **Filters** from the **Parent View**. You can directly change & set the **desired Filters for the Subview. **Those will **OVERWRITE **the**Parent's Filters** . So those changes will NOT reflect/change any filters from the Parent View and will be overwriting the Parent's filters

    So the Subview will show the Tickets **ONLY** by the **Filters set in the Subview**, not by the ones set in the Parent view AND Sub-view
  </Step>
</Steps>
