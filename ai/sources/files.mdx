Since FIles are **unstructured data** for the AI, it's **not** best to upload **very large Files** here with many pages. 

This can rather overcomplicate things and worsen the AI Quality. If you have large files, we would suggest that you reach out to our Support Team [here](mailto:armin@chatarmin.com)
