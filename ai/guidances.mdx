So what is now the main difference between [Q&A](/ai/sources/q-and-a) and Guidances?

Let's explain the difference with examples.

### Guidances Example

Think of them like mini-wikis or internal policies.\
Good for when users need **general info or decision-making frameworks**.

- **Size Guidelines**
- **Return & Refund policies**
- **Payment Methods**
- **Loyalty Program**
- **Shipping & delivery timelines**
- -\> So basically everywhere, where not "one answer" can describe the whole topic

### Q&A Example

Focused, atomic, and scoped.\
Good for when users have **clear, answerable questions**.

- **"How long does shipping take to Germany?"**
- **"Can I return a worn item?"**
- **"What size is Medium in EU sizing?"**
- **"Do you ship internationally?"**
- **"Is the promo code still valid?"**
