### `Main Benefits`

- No need to manually trigger workflows
- Handle complex tasks like **Updating Shipping Address**, **Fetching invoices**, on Full-Auto

### `Where to find?`

- Under [AI](https://armin.cx/_/ai/agents) -\> "**Your AI**" -\> **Workflows**

---

Basically you just need to select the **Flow** you want the AI to be able to trigger & add a **Description** for "**what the goal**" of the flow is. For example:

- **Flow**:`Billbee - Invoice Details`
- **Description:** `Get the Customer's Invoice for their Order`

The better the "Description", the better the AI knows on when to use that Flow
